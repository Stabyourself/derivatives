        title="Position (geometry)",
        excerpt="In geometry, a **position** or **position** **vector**, also known as **location** **vector** or **radius** **vector**, is a Euclidean vector that represents the position of a point *P* in space in relation to an arbitrary reference origin *O*."
    },

        derivatives=1,
        title="Velocity",
        excerpt="The **velocity** of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. \n Velocity is equivalent to a specification of an object's speed and direction of motion (e.g. 60 km/h to the north)."
    },
    {
        derivatives=2,
        title="Acceleration",
        excerpt="In mechanics, **acceleration** is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time. Accelerations are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). \n The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the *net* force acting on that object."

        derivatives=3,
        title="Jerk (physics)",
        excerpt="In physics, **jerk** or **jolt** is the rate at which an object's acceleration changes with respect to time. It is a vector quantity (having both magnitude and direction)."

        derivatives=4,
        title="Fourth derivative (snap/jounce)",
        excerpt="**Snap**, or **jounce**, is the fourth derivative of the position vector with respect to time, or the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time. \n Equivalently, it is the second derivative of acceleration or the third derivative of velocity."

    {
        derivatives=5,
        title="Fifth derivative (crackle/flounce)",
        excerpt="**Crackle** is the fifth derivative of the position vector with respect to time, with the first, second, third, and fourth derivatives being velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap, respectively; crackle is thus the rate of change of the snap with respect to time."

        excerpt="**Pop** (occasionally *Pounce*) is the sixth derivative of the position vector with respect to time, with the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth derivatives being velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap, and crackle, respectively; pop is thus the rate of change of the crackle with respect to time."
